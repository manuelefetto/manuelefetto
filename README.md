## 💡 About Me

I'm a hands-on learner who loves diving into different areas of software development. 
I enjoy exploring the full stack without limiting myself to a single specialization. Balancing university, work, and coding has taught me time management and persistence.

When I'm not coding or studying, you'll find me making pizzas and thinking about my next project idea.
